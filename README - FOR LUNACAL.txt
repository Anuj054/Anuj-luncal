1. Start Command: `npm run dev`.
2. The scrollbar in the About widget scroll bar is functional. 
    It looks bigger than in the Figma file because there is less text.
3. In the gallery widget, the left and right buttons are functional, but they use a smaller value (50). 
    When I tried using the same value (180), I couldn't tell if it was scrolling.
4. I tried my best to make the images visible on hover in the gallery component, 
    but I couldn't make them visible outside the overflow-x-scroll container. 
    I would love to learn how to do that.
5. I also tried to make the button animation in the 'About Me' widget but couldn't; I'd love to learn that too.
6. This project is only responisve for 1920 x 1080 resolution.
